# django_solarROI

This Application is used using the Django Python Framework - and Uses Hashicorp's Vagrant for development and Deployment.

This application is a basic app demonstrating User registration and authentication with roundtrip verification by email, with a basic
web page with a plotting program and layout with interactive buttons to alter the appearance.

The code has several sources - in particular the guides from the django website at https://www.djangoproject.com ,  and the jscolor
code was used for the color selector from http://jscolor.com.

This project was built for a Graduate Course on modern Internet and Web Systems.
